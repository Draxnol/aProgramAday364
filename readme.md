About
================================================
The purpose of this repository is to create a small program a day for as long as possible.

Rules
---
1. Program must complete atleast one task.
2. Program must be more complicated then a hello world program or something similar.
3. Program must be completed once a day starting from 2018-01-11

Disclaimer:
---
The programs presented here are quick prototypes usually completed within a few hours. Due to the time constraints associated with making a program everyday, each program only has enough testing to ensure basic functionally. There is also no error handling unless it was essential to the base functionally of the program.  sssd

|15			|Refactored Classes| Due to computer issues, there was only time to clean up the email helper class and the weather helper class.|
|16			|Weather Email Web App| Part 1 of a mockup webapp that allows users to register using their emails and city name. The webapp then stores this infomation in a database. Part 2 will build upon this by having a control panel that can send everyone in the database a email containing the weather.|
|17			|Weather Email Web App| Part 2. Added the ablitiy to send everyone in the database a email using the methods used in day 14.|
|18         |Refactored the Email Web App| Made code about 98% more pep8 compliant and less likely to cause bleeding from eyes.|

|22			|Weather email app(the SQLquel)| Building on day 21, added the ablitiy to send people emails by retrieving their infomation from one database, then retrieving weather data from another database, sticking it together and sending it.|
